📘 90-Day DevOps & Cloud Learning Plan

📍 Current Level

I am a working professional (Engineer) with a technical background.
I have basic familiarity with software development concepts but limited hands-on experience in DevOps and Cloud-native tooling. My focus is to transition into a practical, execution-oriented DevOps role, not just theoretical learning.



🧠 My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud Engineering

DevOps is a culture and practice that bridges development and operations to deliver software faster, reliably, and at scale through automation, monitoring, and collaboration.

Cloud Engineering enables this by providing on-demand infrastructure, scalability, high availability, and managed services that remove traditional infrastructure bottlenecks.

Together, DevOps + Cloud mean:

Faster deployments

Fewer failures

Scalable, resilient systems

Ownership from code to production

🎯 Why I Am Learning DevOps & Cloud

To build real-world, production-ready skills, not just tool knowledge

To move closer to high-impact engineering roles

To gain ownership over systems, not just write code

To future-proof my career in a cloud-first industry

🚀 Where I Want to Reach (90-Day Vision)

By the end of 90 days, I want to confidently:

Design, deploy, and operate cloud-native applications

Debug issues across infrastructure, pipelines, and containers

Think like a DevOps engineer — proactive, responsible, and systematic

🎯 3 Clear Goals (Next 90 Days)

Deploy a production-style application on Kubernetes using Docker, CI/CD, and cloud infrastructure

Build and manage a complete CI/CD pipeline (Git → Build → Test → Deploy)

Gain hands-on confidence with AWS core services (EC2, IAM, S3, VPC basics)

🛠️ 3 Core DevOps Skills to Build

Linux & System Troubleshooting
(processes, logs, networking basics, permissions)

CI/CD & Automation
(GitHub Actions / Jenkins, pipelines, YAML, automation mindset)

Containers & Kubernetes
(Docker, Kubernetes deployment, services, debugging)

⏱️ Time Commitment & Consistency Plan

Weekly Time Budget

Weekdays: 2 hours/day

Weekends: 4hours/day

Total: ~18–22 hours/week

Consistency Rules I Will Follow

Study every single day, even if only 30–45 minutes

Hands-on > watching videos

No skipping more than one day in a row

Weekly self-review every Sunday (what worked, what didn’t)

📚 Learning Approach & Resources

Primary guidance: TrainWithShubham DevOps roadmap & curriculum

Focus on doing, not over-researching

Build small → break → fix → rebuild

Document learnings and mistakes

🧱 Mindset & Commitment

I understand that:

DevOps is not easy

Confusion and failures are part of the process

Discipline beats motivation

Consistency will compound over time

I take full ownership of my learning.
No excuses. No shortcuts. Just daily execution.
